# What's New in 2025

This year's course includes several important updates to keep pace with industry developments. **FastAPI** now replaces Flask in deployment modules, reflecting current industry preferences for API development. **PyTorch** materials have been added alongside existing Keras content, giving you exposure to both major deep learning frameworks.

For serverless deployment, the course now uses **ONNX Runtime** instead of TensorFlow Lite, providing better cross-framework compatibility. Finally, the **UV Package Manager** is now recommended over Conda for environment management, offering improved performance and reliability.
