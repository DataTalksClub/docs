# Your First Actions

## 1. Access Your Learning Materials

Start by visiting the [ML Zoomcamp GitHub repository](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp) and **starring it** ⭐. All course materials are in this repository, with each module having its own folder (for example, `01-intro` or `03-classification`). [Cohort-specific](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp/tree/master/cohorts) homework and deadlines are located in `cohorts/2025`.

The lectures are pre-recorded and available in the [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3MmuxUbc_hIhxl5Ji8t4O6lPAOpHaCLR), so you can watch them whenever it suits you. Occasionally, additional workshops or updated implementation videos are released—there will be additional announcements if this happens. If nothing is announced, you can assume all necessary materials are already available.

Finally, locate and bookmark the [FAQ Website](https://datatalks.club/faq/machine-learning-zoomcamp.html). This comprehensive resource contains answers to the most frequently asked questions from previous cohorts. Make it a habit to check this document before asking questions in Slack, as your question has likely been answered before.

## 2. Course Structure and Flexibility

The course has **no regular live sessions** except for occasional intro streams, supporting self-paced learning.

While you can progress ahead of [schedule](https://courses.datatalks.club/ml-zoomcamp-2025/), projects have deadlines to maintain cohort synchronization. Learn more about the complete learning path in our [Course Curriculum](curriculum.html) and understand [Assignments and Scoring](assignments-and-scoring.html) requirements.

## 3. Technical Setup

Before diving into the coursework, ensure you have the necessary technical foundation. You'll need basic **Python knowledge** and comfort with the **command line, Git, and Docker**. Create a **GitHub account** where you'll publish all your homework code—detailed setup instructions are covered in our [Prerequisites](prerequisites.html) guide.

## 4. Join the Learning Community

Connect with the vibrant ML Zoomcamp community to enhance your learning experience. After registering for the course, you'll receive an invitation to the **Slack Workspace** via email. Join the workspace and navigate to the "machine-learning-zoomcamp" channel, which serves as your primary support and Q&A platform throughout the course.
