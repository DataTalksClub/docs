# Assignments and Scoring

## 1. Homework

Homework is created fresh for every cohort and its purpose is to help you check your knowledge and practice. It does not count toward your certificate.

Assignments are published under `cohorts/2025/{module}` in the GitHub repository of the course. Once ready, the submission form will be shared in Slack.

The process is simple: solve the tasks locally, publish your solution to a public GitHub repo (or similar), and submit the link through the form.

Each homework comes with a strict deadline listed [on the schedule](https://courses.datatalks.club/ml-zoomcamp-2025/). After the deadline passes, the form closes.

## 2. Staying Updated with Deadlines and Announcements

All homework and project deadlines are published on the [course platform](https://courses.datatalks.club/ml-zoomcamp-2025/).

## 3. Homework for Certification
While homework assignments are **optional for certification**, they're essential for solidifying your understanding of each module's concepts. Homework participation contributes to your overall course score and leaderboard position.

## 4. Leaderboard
Submissions also appear on the [leaderboard](https://courses.datatalks.club/ml-zoomcamp-2025/leaderboard), which adds a fun competitive element. The leaderboard is optional, but many students find it motivating.
