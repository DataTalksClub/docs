## Glossary lesson 1
- Features: All the known characteristics or pieces of information about an object that are used as input to a machine learning model to make a prediction. (e.g., car's age, manufacturer, mileage).
- Target: The specific variable or value that a machine learning model aims to predict. (e.g., the price of a car).
- Model: The output of the machine learning training process; it's an algorithm or system that has learned patterns from data and can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data.
- Prediction: The output generated by a trained machine learning model when it is given new input features, representing the model's estimate for the target variable.
- Machine Learning (ML): A process of extracting patterns and insights from data, allowing a system to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for every specific outcome.
- Data: Raw facts, figures, or information collected for analysis. In machine learning, it refers to the collection of features and targets used for training and testing models.
- Patterns: Regular and discernible relationships or structures within data that machine learning algorithms identify and learn from.
- Rule-based Systems: Traditional programming approaches where a system makes decisions based on a predefined set of explicit rules, often contrasting with the pattern-learning approach of machine learning.
- Training: The process of feeding data (features and corresponding targets) to a machine learning algorithm so that it can learn the underlying patterns and create a model.

## Glossary lesson 2

- Classifier: A system or algorithm that categorizes input into one of several classes (e.g., spam/not spam).
- Features: Measurable characteristics or attributes of the data used by the model (e.g., email length, sender domain).
- Target Variable: The variable that the model is trying to predict or classify (e.g., whether an email is spam or not).
- Training/Fitting: The process of feeding data to a machine learning algorithm so it can learn patterns and create a model.
- Model: The output of the training process; a learned representation that can make predictions on new data.
- Probability: The likelihood of an event occurring, often output by ML models before a final classification decision.
- Decision Threshold: A predefined value used to convert a model's probability output into a definitive classification (e.g., >0.5 means spam).
- Supervised Learning: A type of machine learning where the model learns from labeled data (inputs with known correct outputs). Spam detection and car price prediction are examples.
