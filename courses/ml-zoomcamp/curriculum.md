# Course Curriculum

Your learning path consists of **9 main modules plus project work**.

You'll begin with **Module 1** covering introduction and setup, then progress through **Linear Regression** (Module 2) with a car price prediction project.

**Binary Classification** (Module 3) introduces customer churn prediction, while **Model Evaluation** (Module 4) covers critical but challenging assessment concepts.

**Model Deployment** (Module 5) teaches FastAPI implementation, and **Tree-Based Models** (Module 6) explores loan default prediction.

**Module 7** represents your **Midterm Project**—three weeks of independent work applying everything learned so far.

The advanced modules include **Neural Networks and Deep Learning** (Module 8) with PyTorch, **Serverless Deployment** (Module 9) using AWS Lambda and ONNX, and **Kubernetes Deployment** (Module 10).

**Module 11** covers KServe but is optional and potentially outdated—focus your energy on Kubernetes instead.

## Learning Philosophy

The course follows a **project-first approach** where theory is introduced as needed to solve real problems. This means you'll learn by doing rather than studying abstract concepts first. The emphasis is **practical over theoretical**, focusing on ML engineering skills that you'll use in industry rather than academic theory.

The course is designed to be **community-driven**, encouraging you to learn together, share your progress, and help each other succeed. This collaborative approach mirrors real-world ML engineering environments and builds valuable professional networks.
