# GitHub Repository

The GitHub repository is the most important resource for this course. Use it to navigate through all course materials.

## How to Use the Repository

1. Start in the module folder you're working on
2. Read the README in that folder for an overview
3. Follow the links to video lectures
4. Complete homework assignments
5. Check the cohort folder for any cohort-specific materials

The repository is your primary navigation tool. Each module README links directly to the relevant videos and resources you need.
