## How to Find Playlists

2. Look for the "Playlists" section
3. Browse through the available playlists

You can also access playlists directly from the video you're watching. Look for the playlist name in the video description or below the video title.

## Main Playlist

The Main Playlist contains the core course content - pre-recorded lectures that cover the data engineering curriculum. This is your primary learning resource.

Use the [GitHub repo]({{ '/courses/data-engineering-zoomcamp/resources/github/' | relative_url }}) to navigate. Each module links to the relevant video.

## Cohort Playlists

Each cohort has its own playlist with edition-specific content:

- [2025 Cohort](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJZdpLpRHp7dg6EOx828q6y)
- [2024 Cohort](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3MmuxUbc_hKihpnNQ9qtTmWYy26bPrSb)
- [2023 Cohort](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJjEePXIdE-LVUx_1ZZjYGW)
- [2022 Cohort](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3MmuxUbc_hKVX8VnwWCPaWlIHf1qmg8s)

Cohort Playlists are recorded during specific runs of the course and include:

- Live kick-off streams
- Office hours and Q&A sessions
- Homework review sessions
- Guest lectures and bonus content
- Videos that were part of that cohort but were later removed from the main playlist (outdated, replaced, or improved content)

Cohort playlists are supplementary. They provide additional context and answers to student questions, but they are not required for completing the course. Focus on the main playlist first, then explore your cohort playlist for extra insights.
