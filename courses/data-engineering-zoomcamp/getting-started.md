# Getting Started

## Your First Steps

### 1. Star the GitHub Repository

Visit [github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) and star the repo. This helps others discover the course.

Everything you need is here:

- Video lessons
- Homework questions
- Module content
- Cohort-specific materials

### 2. Join the Slack Workspace

The [DataTalks.Club Slack](https://datatalks.club/slack) is where the community interacts.

1. Join the workspace
2. Browse channels and join [#course-data-engineering](https://app.slack.com/client/T01ATQK62F8/C01FABYF2RG)
3. Use threads when replying to keep conversations organized

### 3. Subscribe to YouTube

Pre-recorded videos are available on the [DataTalks.Club YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DataTalksClub).

Subscribe and check out the [main course playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb). See the [Resources section](resources/) for all playlists.

### 4. Set Up GCP Account (if new)

Google Cloud Platform offers $300 free credits for new accounts. This is useful for Module 1 where you'll work with:
- Docker
- PostgreSQL
- Terraform
- BigQuery

### 5. Start Module 1

Begin with Docker, PostgreSQL, and Terraform. This module gets two weeks because environment setup can be challenging.
