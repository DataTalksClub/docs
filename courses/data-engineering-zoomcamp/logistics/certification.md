# Certification & Graduation

## How to Earn Your Certificate

Complete the [final project]({{ '/courses/data-engineering-zoomcamp/logistics/projects/' | relative_url }}) and participate in peer reviews.

That's the only requirement.

The final project demonstrates your practical skills by building an end-to-end data pipeline with a dashboard. You choose the dataset, tools, and approach.

After submitting, review 3 projects from your cohort to complete the peer review requirement.

## What's NOT Required

- Homework scores don't affect graduation. Homework is for learning, not grading.
- No minimum GPA. Complete the project and peer reviews, and you're done.
- No final exam. Your project speaks for itself.
