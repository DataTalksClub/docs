# The Leaderboard

Earn points by completing homework, sharing your learning publicly, contributing to the FAQ, and finishing your project. See [how the leaderboard works]({{ '/courses/course-management-platform/leaderboard/' | relative_url }}) for the full points breakdown.

The leaderboard creates friendly competition and encourages consistent participation throughout the course.

Only submit links to your own social media posts about the course when earning learning in public points. Submitting unrelated links will result in losing all learning in public points. See the [misuse policy]({{ '/courses/course-management-platform/learning-in-public/' | relative_url }}) for details.

This is totally optional. The leaderboard is just for fun. You can completely ignore it and still get everything you need from this course. The main goal is for you to learn data engineering.

## Anonymous by Default

Your leaderboard entry is anonymous by default. You're assigned an auto-generated name so others don't know who you are. If you want to be visible, you can choose to:

- Use your real name instead of the generated one
- Add links to your social media profiles (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.)
- Write a short bio

People at the top of the leaderboard do get noticed. If you want to convert this attention into new opportunities (job offers, collaborations, networking), you can update your [enrollment profile](https://courses.datatalks.club/de-zoomcamp-2026/enrollment).
