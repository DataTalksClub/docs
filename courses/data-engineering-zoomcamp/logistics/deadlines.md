# Deadlines & Schedule

For the most up-to-date curriculum, visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main) or see the [GitHub resources page]({{ '/courses/data-engineering-zoomcamp/resources/github/' | relative_url }}) for documentation about the repository structure.

The course content is delivered through multiple formats:

- Pre-recorded videos on the DataTalks.Club YouTube channel
- Office hours recordings available from previous cohorts
- Live sessions for specific topics (like launch streams)

All videos are free to access and can be watched at your own pace.
