# Final Project

Build an end-to-end data pipeline with a dashboard using any dataset, tools, and cloud provider you choose.

## What You'll Build

Over two weeks, create a pipeline that:

- Ingests data from your chosen source
- Processes and stores it in a data lake
- Moves it to a data warehouse
- Transforms it for analysis
- Visualizes results in a dashboard

## Your Choices

You decide:

- Dataset (any source you're interested in - see [datasets](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/projects/datasets.md) for suggestions)
- Processing approach (batch or stream)
- Cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.)
- Tools (Terraform, Airflow, Spark, Kafka, dbt, etc.)

## Dashboard

Create a dashboard with at least two visualizations. Use Looker Studio, Streamlit, or any BI tool.

## Evaluation

Peer review is mandatory to pass the project. After submitting, you must review 3 projects from your cohort. See the [peer review guide]({{ '/courses/course-management-platform/peer-review/' | relative_url }}) for evaluation tips and process details.

Your project will be assessed on:

- Problem description and clarity
- Cloud and infrastructure-as-code usage
- Data ingestion pipeline (batch or stream)
- Data warehouse optimization
- Data transformations
- Dashboard quality
- Code reproducibility and documentation
