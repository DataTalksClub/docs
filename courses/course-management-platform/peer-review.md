# Peer Review

Peer review is a mandatory part of the project. After submitting your project, review 3 projects from your cohort.

## How It Works

1. Submit your own project
2. Receive 3 peer projects to review
3. Evaluate each project based on criteria
4. Provide constructive feedback

## Why Peer Review

- Learn from different approaches and solutions
- See how others interpreted the same requirements
- Develop critical thinking about data engineering
- Contribute back to the community

## Evaluation Criteria

Each course has its own evaluation criteria. The platform will display the specific rubric when reviewing. Criteria typically assess project quality, documentation, and reproducibility.

## Tips for Good Reviews

- Submit before the deadline even if you're not 100% confident in your evaluation
- Be constructive and specific
- Highlight strengths as well as areas for improvement
- Explain your reasoning
- Respect the effort peers put in

Remember: The person whose project you're reviewing is learning, just like you. Be kind and helpful.
