# Community & Communication

## Where to Ask Questions

Use Slack for all questions and discussions. The course team monitors Slack and answers questions there.

## Slack Workspace

The [DataTalks.Club Slack](https://datatalks.club/slack) is where the community interacts and where to get help.

### Getting Started

1. Join the [DataTalks.Club Slack](https://datatalks.club/slack)
2. Browse channels and join [#course-data-engineering](https://app.slack.com/client/T01ATQK62F8/C01FABYF2RG)
3. Use threads when replying to keep conversations organized

### Important Guidelines

- Don't DM course team members directly. Keep discussions in public channels.
- Use threads for discussions. This keeps conversations organized and readable.
- Search before asking. Your question was likely already answered.

## Telegram Channel (Announcements Only)

Join the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp Telegram channel](https://t.me/dezoomcamp) for course announcements and updates only.

### Important Notes

- Telegram is for announcements only, not for questions or discussions.
- We do NOT monitor questions in Telegram. All questions should be asked in Slack.
- Announcements are automatically reposted to Slack. You'll get them even without Telegram.

- Why install Telegram? Slack is busy and announcements can get lost there. Telegram ensures you never miss important updates.

### Communication Summary

- Slack: Questions, discussions, help. Monitored by course team.
- Telegram: Announcements only. Not monitored by course team.

## Asking Questions Effectively

Before asking, check these resources:

### 1. Q&A Document

Comprehensive answers to common questions are available in the course Q&A.

### 2. ZoomCamp Q&A Bot

A Slack bot that searches the Q&A and previous questions. Often faster than waiting for a human response.

### 3. Google

Surprisingly effective. Many questions have been answered on Stack Overflow, GitHub issues, or blogs.

## Community Culture

The DataTalks.Club community values:
- Helpful peers. Students help each other learn.
- Respectful communication. Be kind and patient.
- Learning together. Everyone starts somewhere.

Remember: The person answering your question is a volunteer. Be appreciative and pay it forward by helping others when you can.
