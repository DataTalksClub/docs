# YouTube Playlists

Subscribe to the [DataTalks.Club YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DataTalksClub) for course videos.

## Main Playlist

[Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb)

Contains all course videos. Use the GitHub repo to navigate. Each module links to the relevant video.

## Cohort Playlists

Each cohort has its own playlist with edition-specific content:

- [2025 Cohort](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJZdpLpRHp7dg6EOx828q6y)
- [2024 Cohort](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3MmuxUbc_hKihpnNQ9qtTmWYy26bPrSb)
- [2023 Cohort](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJjEePXIdE-LVUx_1ZZjYGW)
- [2022 Cohort](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3MmuxUbc_hKVX8VnwWCPaWlIHf1qmg8s)

Cohort playlists include live sessions, office hours, and streams from that specific cohort. These are great for extra learning, but it's easy to get lost. Stick to the main playlist and your cohort playlist for the most relevant content.
