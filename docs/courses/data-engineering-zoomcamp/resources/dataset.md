## About the Dataset

The NYC Taxi Trip dataset includes trips with pickup/dropoff locations that you'll analyze using various data engineering tools. This dataset is ideal for learning data engineering because:

- Real-world data with realistic quality issues
- Large enough to require proper engineering techniques
- Well-documented schema
- Free and publicly available

## What You'll Do With It

Across the modules, you'll:

- Ingest the data into various storage systems
- Transform and clean the data
- Build batch and streaming pipelines
- Create analytics and visualizations

This hands-on approach ensures you gain practical experience with actual data, not just theoretical concepts.
