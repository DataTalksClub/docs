# Certification & Graduation

## How to Earn Your Certificate

To earn a certificate, you must:

### 1. Complete the Final Project Successfully

Build your own data pipeline resulting in a dashboard. You choose:
- The dataset
- The tools (batch/streaming/mix)
- The data warehouse destination

The project demonstrates your practical skills and is the primary requirement for graduation.

### 2. Participate in Peer Reviews

Review 3 other projects from your cohort. This helps you:
- Learn from different approaches
- See how others solved similar problems
- Contribute back to the community

## What's NOT Required

- Homework scores don't affect graduation. Homework is for learning, not grading.
- No minimum GPA. Complete the project and peer reviews, and you're done.
- No final exam. Your project speaks for itself.

## Your Certificate

Upon successful completion:
- You'll receive a certificate of completion
- You can add it to your LinkedIn profile
- It serves as proof of your practical data engineering skills

## After the Course

The certificate is just the beginning. Many graduates have:
- Landed data engineering jobs through the course network
- Built portfolios showcasing their projects
- Continued learning in public and growing their skills
